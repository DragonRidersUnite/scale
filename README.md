**Simple DragonRuby Game Toolkit Game Starter Template**

Quickly start a new DragonRuby Game Toolkit game with helpful extensions.

## Bugs / Features

Last tested against DragonRuby Game Toolkit v3.24.

- Displays framerate in the upper-right hand corner of the game when running in development mode
- `#debug?` helper to easily check if the game is running in development mode; useful for custom commands
- Reload all sprites in development using the `i` key, requires use of `SPATHS` constant
- Reset the game with `r` key, calls `$gtk.reset`
- Put all debug-only code in `#debug_tick`
- `#init` method that gets run once on game boot
- `CHEATSHEET.md` with common APIs from DRGTK and Scale
- `#version` to get the version of your game
- Constants for various values and enums: `FPS`, `BLEND_*`, `ALIGN_*`

## Use It

There are two main ways you can use the Scale template for your games.

### Download the Zip

The fastest way to get started is to download the template zip file and put it into your unzipped DragonRuby Game Toolkit folder.

4. Unzip the `scale-main.zip`
5. Move the `scale-main` folder into the DRGTK folder
6. Rename `scale-main` to `mygame`
7. Start DragonRuby, and make an awesome game!

### Use GitHub's Template System

If you're going to track your game with Git and use GitHub, the baked-in template system will get you going quickly.

1. View the project on GitHub: https://github.com/DragonRidersUnite/scale

3. Click "Create a new repository"
4. Fill out the details and create the repository
5. Unzip the DragonRuby Game Toolkit engine zip
6. Delete the `mygame` directory
7. Clone your new repository into the DRGTK engine folder with the folder name `mygame`, example: `git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO.git mygame`
